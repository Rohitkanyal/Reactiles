        <h3>Musicman Majesty Artisan</h3>

        <p>
          The Artisan Majesty is an update of the version released in 2014 and features some significant differences from the original design. Visually the guitar is the same unique shape with the exaggerated contours and horns compared to the JP models but, unlike last yearâ€™s basswood model, the Artisan version features an African mahogany body matched to the same laser etched maple top, Honduran mahogany neck with and ebony fretboard from the original. Hardware is identical to the JP15 model above with stainless steel frets, locking tuners, Illuminator humbuckers and floating bridge with piezo saddles. The controls also function identically with the same 20dB boost on the volume pot and split coil option on the tone pot plus the piezo volume and EQ controls on the back. The only marked difference in hardware is the removal of the dual output jacks in favour of a single jack that can be switched between stereo and mono operation via a push/push function on the piezo volume pot.The Artisan Majesty is a stunning looking guitar and a little easier on the eyes than the original, thanks to the translucent finishes showing the lovely mahogany grain and flame maple top. The same laser etched shield is still present and looks great, offering a futuristic carbon-fibre effect to this already modern looking instrument. The addition of gold hardware gives the Majesty a majestic (excuse the pun) look and the five different finishes are all attractive and more understated than the previous opaque colours offered on the 2014 model.
